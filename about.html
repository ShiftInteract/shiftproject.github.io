  <h2><i>Who We Are</i></h2>
	<p>The Shift Project was founded in March 2017 by three seniors from the first graduating class of Frassati Catholic High School in Spring, Texas. Ian McIninch, Josh Davidson, and Jack Edwards have a passion for promoting human interaction in a wholesome manner. The initiative hopes to introduce further means of spreading our message and impacting communities as our project develops, so others can carry it on long after we leave. These include a mobile application, a podcast, and possibly live talks.</p>
  <h2><i>Our Mission</i></h2>
	<p>Humanity thrives on interaction and communication. Yet it seems, tragically, that we have simply forgotten how to encounter one another truthfully, vibrantly, and with authenticity. Much of this is due to the misuse of modern technology. The Shift Project seeks to communicate this situation, incentives for changing it, and practical advice to make one&#39s interaction and communication truly authentic. Using pamphlets, a website, a blog, and other media, the Shift Project empowers individuals to simply and profoundly improve the way they interact, seeking ever greater truth and awareness of the world around us.</p>
